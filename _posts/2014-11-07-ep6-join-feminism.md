  Script:

  CEO: Feminists are complaining about harassment. We have to do something about them.
  Employee 1: We could objectify them in video games.
  Employee 2: We could way we're going to rape them.
  Employee 3/Secretly Robin: We could join them because they're right.
  [4chan Building]
  Batman: Did you get the files?
  Robin: I got them. There's a lot of info on us. Some of it is really gross. But nothing about who woke us. I don't think it was anyone at 4chan.
  Batman: Then we're out of leads. We'll have to pay another visit to the king...
