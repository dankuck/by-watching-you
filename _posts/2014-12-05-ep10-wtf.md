  Script:

  Robin: Put me down you Black Friday zombies. Alright, I just felt a thumb. Who was that?!
  			Focus Robin meme. Remember your training. Except I don't have any training. I'm not the real Robin.
  			What? Where did everybody go? Awkward.
  			Did I defeat them with my mind?
  Batman: No, it was simpler than that. Black Friday was just weak this year. They went home.
  Robin: Oh good, I was afraid I was starting to understand this place.
  			I can't get my bearings, Batman. I feel lost constantly.
  			My memories aren't even real. You know what that's like?
  Batman: Real is relative around here. If it's a meme, it's real.
  Robin: Like that time you said "I'm the goddamn Batman!" and called me retarded.
  Batman: Eh... That meme wasn't very popular.
  Robin: Wow, how is this car so fast?
  Batman: Well... I got it from a Hitler meme... Hitler is a strong meme.
  			So you could say it runs on Hitler power.		
  Robin: I'm sure there's no way that could bite us in the ass.
