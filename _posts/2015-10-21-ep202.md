  Script:

  Kermit: You forgot Salt-n-Pepa's Grammy winning single "None of your Business". But that's none of my business.
  [Kermit's face scrunches up]
  Batman: This is your business. I spiked your tea to immobilize you. Because your meme is no good. Your indifference is a cancer in the world. When this wears off, I don't want to see you around. Not your business? I just made it your business.
  [Kermit laid out on the ground.]
