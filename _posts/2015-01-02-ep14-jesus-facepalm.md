  Script:

  Jesus: I'm the god damn Jesus meme!
  Robin: You brought us to life? Didn't you try to kill us?
  Flash back Jesus: Swear to me!
  [Screeeetch!]
  Jesus: No time to chit chat. It's the memes! Something's gotta be done about the memes!
  Jesus: We'll take your Hitler-mobile.
  Meme: When you ride with JESUS, your side kick has to ride in the back.
  Jesus: Hill Valley, 2015! Look over there. He's doing it again!
  Meme: Today is the day that Marty McFly arrives when he travels to the future.
