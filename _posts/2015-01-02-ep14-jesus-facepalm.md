  Script:

  Jesus: I'm the god damn Jesus meme!
  Robin: You brought us to life? Didn't you try to kill us?
  Flash back Jesus: Swear to me!
  [Screeeetch!]
  Jesus: No time to chit chat. It's the memes! Something's gotta be done about the memes!
  Jesus: We'll take your Hitler-mobile.
  Meme: When you ride with JESUS, your side kick has to ride in the back.
  Jesus: Hill Valley, 2015! Look over there. He's doing it again!
  Meme: Today is the day that Marty McFly arrives when he travels to the future.
  Robin: This isn't the day Marty Mcfly travels to the future!
  Jesus: That's right, nerd. But the Marty McFly meme is trying to take the whole year. Go stop him, Batman.
  Batman: What? How? And why?
  Jesus: Marty made 2014 just about unbearable with this meme. And now that it's the right year, it'll only get worse! Spitball some ideas.
  Batman: Uh well... how about... (Idea: Have a debate between Batman and Marty McFly)
  Jesus: Worse. Super genius. Ever.
  Batman: Ok, then (Idea: Have a FACEBOOK debate between Batman and Marty McFly)
  Jesus: [Facepalm]
  Batman: Wait! I know what to do.
  Marty McFly: Today's the day that Marty McFly trav--
  Batman: SLAP! Back to the Future day is OCTOBER 21st!
  Jesus: Good enough.
  Achievement Unlocked: Mild approval from God's son.
