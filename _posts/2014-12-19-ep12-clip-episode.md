  Script:

  "Previously on By Watching You"
  Narrated by The Plot Exposition Sugar Glider.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: It's a clip episode!
  First, the Batman meme woke up and realized something was wrong...
  Batman: This doesn't make sense
  Phillip J. Fry: Not sure if this is part of the comic, or about the comic

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: They were in a strange place and about to meet strange people.
  Robin: Where are we?
  Fry: I hate when people ask a question that no one around them would know the answer to.
  Robin: Hello, danger?

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Doge was the king. Robin didn't have a moment to catch his breath.
  Doge: Wordbank! Attack!
  Fry: Not sure if doge saying "wordbank" or wordbank saying it.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Until he met a friendly stranger. Not everyone in this place was bad.
  Driving dog: No time to explain. Get in the van.
  Fry: Not sure if creepy van meme, or driving dog meme.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: On the other hand, it turned out to be no stranger at all.
  Batman: I'm Batman meme!
  Fry: Not sure if angry, or just passionate.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: They were in a world of memes. A dangerous place for anyone who wouldn't place along.
  Batman: Jesus, if you take this wheel, I swear to god.
  Jesus: Swear to me!
  Screeeeeetch!
  Fry: Not sure if sacrilegious, or exactly what Jesus would do...

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Batman meme learned the truth and there was a BIG REVEAL.
  Batman: Someone woke us for a reason.
  Fry: Not sure if comic is going somewhere, or just a series of dramatic poses.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Armed with nothing and driven by a singular purpose, to find who turned them from unthinking memes to self aware heroes, their search came up short. They needed help.
  Batman: Then we're out of leads. We'll have to pay another visit to the king...

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: But even getting back to the Doge King in this place was perilous. They got side tracked more than once.
  Fry whistles: Too Many Cooks
  Robin: Alright, I just felt a thumb. Who was that?!

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: They had to make some decisions that tested their principles.
  "When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler! Join a car-sharing club today!"
  Fry: Not sure if quiet or both quietly angry.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Meanwhile, this new life was beginning to take a toll.
  Robin: I can't get my bearings, Batman. I feel lost constantly. My memories aren't even real. You know what that's like?
  Batman: Real is relative around here. If it's a meme, it's real.
  Fry: Not sure if self awareness is all that great.

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: Batman faced off against the Doge King's stooge, the wordbank, knowing that a meme's power comes from its popularity. Or does it?
  POW!

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: With Batman defeated and unable to escape, the Doge King had a magnanimous change of heart. Really he just decided these two posted not threat to his power as king of the memes.
  Batman: A truce?
  Doge: wow, so silly, such harmless, ask questions, doges knows
  Batman: Tell me who woke me.

  Fry: Hey... I'm sure he wasn't raining when that clip was originally published...
  Fry: And I've never heard of a Plot Exposition Sugar Glider...
  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: I'm a real meme. I swear!

  Plot Exposition Sugar Glider: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
