  Script:

  Jesus: It won't be easy getting in. There are a lot of Monsanto monsters in the way.
  Batman: Well, let's get started. Jesus, take the wheel.
  Jesus: I don't know how to drive.
  Batman: Hold her steady, Robin. And don't slow down.
  Robin: Should we really be going to Monsanto for meme advice? Most Monsanto memes are anti-Monsanto.
  Jesus: Monsanto memes are all made by Monsanto.
  Batman [FIGHTING]: GMO corn is made out of the same stuff as all corn!
  Jesus: That worked. But it was too educational. And for God's sake, quit using that worn out slap meme.
  Jesus [continues]: You see, Robin, they invented these monsters and their memes to protect their empire.
  Philosoraptor: If organic is bad and GMO's are good, shouldn't they be proud to label them?
  Batman [FIGHTING]: Labeling is what they deserve. But not what they need, right now!
  Jesus: Good. I'm not sure I get it, but that's not what matters. And you're branching out.
  Jesus [continues]: Robin, Monsanto's competition is fierce. They control it by making the GMO business look risky.
  Batman [confronted by tumor mice]: What?
  Batman: Is that even a meme?
  Jesus: Yeah, well usually it's paired with some dubious claim about how these rats got those tumors.
  Jesus: You can do this, Batman. You're a super genius.
  Batman: I'm Batman, Your Argument Is Invalid.
  Jesus: Yes!!! You cleared the entire road with that one.
  [snap!]
  Robin: What the... a net?
  Jesus: Not just any net.
  Jesus: Gentlemen, we've been caught by a Monsanto lawsuit.
