  Script:

  Robin meme: We're memes? Like those ats with bad grammar?
  Batman meme: Not just those. A meme is information that spreads... HOLD ON!
  Batman meme: Jesus, if you take this wheel, I swear to God...
  Jesus meme: Swear to me!
  Batman meme: An Internet photo evolves into a meme once you feel homicidal at the sight of it.
  Batman meme: So memes are often hostile.
  Robin meme: Is this another one of your meme friends?
  Batman meme: Honey badger is not friendly. Honey badger don't care.
  Robin meme: That doesn't explain why we keep changing.
  Batman meme: Memes change when people add to them. But people are lazy. They don't make sure the pictures match.
  Banana GIF meme: Peanut Butter Jelly Time. Where ya at?
  Honey Badger: /slip/
  Robin meme: Batman! That banana... you murdered it!
  Batman meme: He'll recover. And he didn't feel it. He hasn't been awoken.
  Robin meme: Awoken? They have to be awoken? Does that mean...
  Batman meme: Yes!
  Batman meme: Someone woke us for a reason.
  [HOLY PLOT EXPOSITION!]
  Robin meme: What the actual fuck?
