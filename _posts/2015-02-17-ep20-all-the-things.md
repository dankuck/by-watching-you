  Script:

  Batman: Train me in the ways of GMOs, troll scientists.
  Trolls: lol, new fag, n00b, obvious newb is obvious, do you even lift?
  Trolls: fag, fag, fag, ...
  [POW!]
  Trolls: LOL. Ok, newb. Follow us.
  Trolls: To make GMOs, you can go to school and learn about genes like a chump. But we prefer the asshole way...
  Trolls: RADIATION ALL THE THINGS!
  Jesus: He means "irradiate" all the things.
  Robin: I can't even tell which one is talking.
  Trolls: To make GMOs, we plant crops around nuclear waste and wait until they mutate.
  Trolls: We keep the ones that we can sell. We tame the ones that we can use. The U.S. marines deal with the rest.
  Batman: But to make memes that way, you need to find a source of memetic radiation. Something truly toxic and deadly!
  Trolls: That's where we hit a road block. We can't find an appropriate mutagen.
  Batman: Have you tried--
  Trolls: Yes, of course.
  Trolls: But raw YouTube comments are just too volatile.
