  Script:

  PART 1

  [1. Interior darkened warehouse]
  Robin: Why did Batman want to meet us here?
  Jesus: I honestly don't know.

  [2. Batman's silohette]
  Batman: I learned it by watching you.

  [3. trio view]
  Noid: That's omenous.
  Jesus: Not really the kind of thing you start with when you're revealing a big secret about the science of memes.

  [4. Another Batman silhouette]
  Batman: It's the key to memes. But that doesn't matter.

  [5. Batman head on]
  Batman: Because I'm not giving it to you.

  [6. trio view]
  Jesus: Well, actually you just told us it's "by watching you".

  [7. Batman shadows again]
  Batman: I learned a lot from both of you. You Noid.

  [8. Noid view]
  Batman: You're not actively evil. You're just selfish. You don't go out of your way to make the world worse.

  [9. Monsters flashback]
  Batman: You just don't care enough to stop it.

  [10. Trio view]
  Noid: That's fair.

  [11. Jesus view]
  Batman: But you Jesus.

  [12. Batman silhouette]
  Batman: Or should I say Jesus meme?

  [13. Some Jesus memes]
  Batman: Because you're not the real Jesus. 

  [14. Batman silhouette]
  Batman: You're just the meme. Like all of us, you're the idea of Jesus.

  [15. Jesus memes]
  Batman: But you're completely broken. You have borderline personality disorder. People never agree on you.

  [16. Batman silhouette]
  Batman: And you don't care. You only want power. You want to spread and lord it over everyone. You don't care about anything.

  [17. Jesus washing feet]
  Batman: But Jesus was a servant to people. He cared about people.

  [18. Jesus character view]
  Batman: Hell, I'm more like Jesus than you.

  [19. Batman looking pensive]

  [20. Jesus view]
  Jesus: You wish. I made you! I gave you life. When I found you, you were a mindless meme like the rest of them.

  [21. Batman silhouette over jesus view]
  Batman: No, that's it. I'm more like Jesus than you.

  [22. Batman JESUS!]
  Batman: I AM the new Jesus!

  [23. Jesus view]
  Jesus: You're mad! But that does remind me of me when I was a younger meme.

  [24. Batman Jesus View]
  Batman: You brought me to life because you needed me, but I don't need you. I'm everything you ever were and more!

  [25. Batman view]
  Robin: NO!

  [26. Robin view]
  Robin: Batman, no...
