  Script:

  Jesus: Your work to defeat the Marty McFly meme was just OK. It was solid, but not perfect. It has the makings of a good meme. At least you learned Lesson 1.
  Lesson 1: Fight memes with memes.
  Jesus: On to Lesson 2. There's a meme down the street that--
  Batman: No!!!
  Robin: You haven't explained shit. You didn't even tell us why you tried to kill us.
  Jesus: Use your brain, kid. Memes can't be killed in a car accident.
  Batman: We're not going anywhere, until you explain what you want from us.
  Jesus: ...
  Jesus: Fine. Batman, get one of the newspapers from that box.
  Meme: This meme has been censored because the artist is afraid of jihadists. #JeSuisCharlie
  Batman: Who did this?
  Jesus: It hardly matters. This was truly the work of an atrocious and powerful meme. I can't fight memes by myself anymore. I grow weaker every year. I'm a joke. I've made mistakes in the past. But now I need your help.
  Batman: ... OK. What do you need me to do?
