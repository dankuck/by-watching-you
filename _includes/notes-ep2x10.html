    Do you think anyone noticed I missed a few
    publication dates? No? Whew!

    I've been falling into a pattern: Wednesdays
    are pure jokes, Fridays advance the story.
    I don't promise it'll stay that way, but it
    feels right.

    Which is exactly what your dad said to your
    mom the night you were conceived. Are you 
    still searching for him? Good for you.
    Never give up a lost cause.
